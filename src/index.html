<!-- 
  This index.html is a placeholder for a Development index page.
  It will be copied to /dist folder so you can quickly develop
  the app instead of having to go a mobius's qbeditor page.

  Note: 
    - Local server that serves the /dist folder must be running
      in order for this to work.
    - The `matches` property in manifest.json must have the local server listed
    - Alternatively, go to https://www.blank.org for quick development
